# CSCI231-Project-7
This program creates an array of 10 integers ranging between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The largest and smallest values in the array are found, as well as the average of all the integers. A user then chooses a value and the program determines if that said value is in the array. Finally, the program sorts the array via. selection sort and the final (sorted) array is printed out.
